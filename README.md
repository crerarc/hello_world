## Introductory Perfunctory
In my head I'm 26, but my body is a tad older. I've worked in Academia, Defence and Energy industries doing fancy things with numerical modelling that sometimes required a bit of coding - sequential Fortran and C usually, but I never had formal training in either. I became an Engineer, but I think really wanted to become a Computer Scientist/ Developer, so I'm doing CS50 to see how I get on. I'm a bit curious, open to new people and ideas and always happy to help, but don't really like talking about myself, so going to stop now :-)
