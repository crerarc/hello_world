## A brief introduction
Formally educated as an engineer, with experience in research, defence (naval platforms), and energy (oil and gas, nuclear, and renewables) sectors. Currently, developing and applying data science skills.

After Uni. I worked on research into the environmental degradation of structural materials, and then, at a different institution, the performance of structural elements under fire conditions. My final university based research was the development of numerical modelling based optimization methods to  produce optimal structural forms. This work was the basis for numerous papers, further research funding, and practically, the significantly improving a key component of an industrial product.

Leaving academia, I worked in the defence research sector, doing various numerical and statistical modelling, database development, software development, primarily to model and understand the behaviour of naval, and occasionally civil, platform performance under operational conditions. This work developed various novel approaches and involved presenting widely.

I was subsequently presented with an opportunity (I found difficult to refuse) to work in the energy sector. This work was mostly related to doing the same type of modelling, analysis and development work, but in the context of assessing the structural integrity of, primarily, offshore oil and gas facilities, as well as nuclear and renewable energy components.

A sharp downturn in oil price in the mid 2010s led to redundancy and looking for something new. Using and developing computational methods to derive meaning is at the core of what I do, and, being curiosity driven, it is enthralling to apply existing, and new, skills to find answers in the broadly defined area of Data Science.

## Key developer & data skills
| Skill | Typical use | Notes |
|-------|----------------------|-------|
| Python | App building, scripting, Data munging and analysis| I've used Python and many of it's libraries (e.g., pyqt, scikit-learn, scipy, numpy, pandas, pilow, plotly, matplotlib, etc.) in many different stand alone and back-end (with flask & django) applications for a long time. What it doesn't have on the execution time, it more than makes up for in terms of the available libraries and ease of use. |
| SQL | All things RDMS | Mostly MySQL and SQLite using Workbench and Studio respectively, or writing directly. |
| C | Application Development | It's still popular and in active use for a reason! I learnt (looking back, poorly) C building a viewer for a novel, low-cost infra-red camera. Since, I've endeavoured to take my C skills to a higher level. |
| Java | Application Development | I started developing apps in Java out of expediency, as it was the quickest and most effective way to build a cross-platform, GUI based analysis / design tool at the time.  I'd done some C++, but Java was really my first venture into OOP. Java can be a bit ungainly and Python has encroached into many areas where I'd once have used Java, but I still use it. |
| HTML/ CSS/ JS | Many Front-End developments | I started out building web pages to show-case my research when web-pages were just HTML. I've built many pages/sites since, for myself, organisations, and others, either from scratch or using an existing frameworks (bootstrap), and including (or not) JS functionality |
| Fortran | Numerical Modelling Software | Easily derided as an old sequential code, but still one of the fastest compiled codes for solving large numerical problems |
| Go | Learning, for web/ CLI development | Learning out of interest - on the face of things, memory management better than C and it's cleaner to write than Java. |
| Kotlin | Learning, for Android development | Learning for Mobile App development, out of interest. Much cleaner than Java, and any language that declares functions as 'fun' can't be bad! |
| IDE/ Editors | Coding/ Scripting | Key tools: Vi (esoteric but essential), VSCode (not a big fan of Microsoft, but love this), Code::Blocks, Netbeans. I use Anaconda/ Conda environment for it's libraries, but develop more in VSCode than Spyder, and Colab more than Jupyter notebooks. And if you use notebooks, you use Markdown, LaTex and html |
| Operating Systems | Preferably Linux; Windows if I have to | Used to work on SunOS/HP-UX systems until Linux (many distros) came along. My liking of MS Windows environments is inversely proportional to the time I've spent using them... and I've been using them for a good long while! Very familiar with both types of operating system and with shell scripting in either. |
| Communication/ Presentation | Team effectivness, Written Work, Internal and External presentation. | Maybe a truism to say that effective communication is essential to achieving anything, but I've seen the damage of it done badly, and the uplift from it being done well. A skill learned by observation and in hindsight. |
